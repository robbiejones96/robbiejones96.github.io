### Section 30: Definition of the Limit of a Function

### 30.1
Let \\(\epsilon > 0\\). It is clear that

$$
	|f(x) - c| = |c - c| = 0 < \epsilon
$$

for any \\(x \in \mathbb{R}\\), so we can choose any \\(\delta > 0 \in \mathbb{R}\\) and this will hold.

### 30.2

Let \\(\epsilon > 0 \\) and choose \\(\delta = \frac{\epsilon}{6}\\). Then for \\(0 < \|x - 2\| < \delta\\), we have

$$
	|6x - 2 - 10| = |6x - 12| = 6|x - 2| < 6\frac{\epsilon}{6} = \epsilon. 
$$

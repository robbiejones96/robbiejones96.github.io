## Section 15: Divergent Sequences

### 15.1

Let \\(f : \mathbf{P} \to \mathbf{P}\\) be a function associated with some subsequence of \\(\\{a_n\\}\\), and let \\(M\\) be a real number.  Since \\(\\{a_n\\}\\) is a divergent sequence, there exists a positive integer \\(N\\) such that if \\(n \geq N\\), then \\(a_n > M\\). In a previous section we showed that \\(f(n) \geq f(N) \geq N\\), so it immediately follows that \\(a_{f(n)} > M\\).
